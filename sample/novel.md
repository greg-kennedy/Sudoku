## Introduction

*Mon Aug 28 06:34:28 2017*

Bob had gone off to work, and the children were at school. Alice was alone in the house, with her cat and her thoughts.

Alice sat down at the kitchen table. She placed a full coffee cup nearby, and her Sudoku puzzle book in the space before her.

Alice was not a very good Sudoku player. She knew a few tricks, but they worked only for the easiest puzzles. Usually when Alice got stuck, she would copy the position, and take a guess. It was often frustrating. Alice was tenacious though; besides, the repetition helped take her mind off things.

She took up a sharpened pencil, then opened the puzzle book to the next unsolved problem.

## Puzzle #1
*Mon Aug 28 06:35:20 2017*

![....79.65.....3..2..5.6..9334..5.1.6.........6.8.2..5995..1.6..7..6.....82.39....](000079065000003002005060093340050106000000000608020059950010600700600000820390000.png "....79.65.....3..2..5.6..9334..5.1.6.........6.8.2..5995..1.6..7..6.....82.39....")

Alice began looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
Box 3 had a cell B8 which, she reasoned, could only be a 1. So she pencilled one there. 
She found that cell B1 could only contain a 4: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she inserted one there. 
This left cell B5 with only one option: a 8. 
So she inserted one there. 
Alice found that cell B4 could only contain a 5: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She pencilled a 5 in B4. 

Once again Alice checked for a move.
Alice found that cell B7 could only contain a 7: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she inserted it there. 
Alice found that cell H5 could only contain a 4: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She quickly inserted in a 4 in H5. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

![....79.654..583712..5.6..9334..5.1.6.........6.8.2..5995..1.6..7..64....82.39....](000079065400583712005060093340050106000000000608020059950010600700640000820390000.png "....79.654..583712..5.6..9334..5.1.6.........6.8.2..5995..1.6..7..64....82.39....")

Alice took a deep breath. She brushed the hair away from her eyes.

Alice started to reminisce. 
Thinking about Bob usually soothed her, but... She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving her children. She was troubled about writing. Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.
She found that cell E5 could only contain a 3: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She sketched in a 3 at E5. 
There was obviously only one choice for a 3 on row F: cell F7. So she sketched it there. 

Again Alice checked for a move.
Row E had a cell E1 which, Alice realized, could only hold a 5. So she put it there. 
There was only one choice for a 6 on row E, and that was cell E6. So she added one there. 

Alice checked the puzzle carefully.
There was only one choice for a 6 on row I, and that was cell I3. She carefully pencilled in a 6 at I3. 
Alice found that cell B3 could only contain a 9: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she added it there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

![....79.654.9583712..5.6..9334..5.1.65...36...6.8.2.35995..1.6..7..64....82639....](000079065409583712005060093340050106500036000608020359950010600700640000826390000.png "....79.654.9583712..5.6..9334..5.1.65...36...6.8.2.35995..1.6..7..64....82639....")

Alice wiped off her glasses with a cloth. She studied the puzzle intently.

Alice let her thoughts drift. 
She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving the news. People often told her not to focus on negative things, but it was difficult. Something about writing was making her uncomfortable. She thought idly of the party.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.

Again she checked for a move.
This left cell B2 with only one option: a 6. 
She quickly etched in a 6. 
A careful check of row I showed that cell I9 was a 1. She carefully sketched a 1 at I9. 
Alice found that cell H9 could only contain a 8: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully put a 8 at H9. 
Column 3 included a cell G3 which, Alice reasoned, could only be a 4. She wrote a 4 in G3. 

Alice reviewed the puzzle again.
This left cell G9 with only one option: a 7. 
So she wrote one there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

![....79.65469583712..5.6..9334..5.1.65...36...6.8.2.359954.1.6.77..64...882639...1](000079065469583712005060093340050106500036000608020359954010607700640008826390001.png "....79.65469583712..5.6..9334..5.1.65...36...6.8.2.359954.1.6.77..64...882639...1")

Alice sighed softly. She sharpened her pencil to a point.

Alice began to daydream. 
Drab colors filled her mind. Something about the news was making her uncomfortable. People often told her not to focus on negative things, but it was difficult. Thinking about writing usually soothed her, but...

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.
Alice found that cell E9 could only contain a 4: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she wrote it there. 
Alice found that cell I8 could only contain a 4: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she placed it there. 
She found that cell I7 could only contain a 5: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she inserted it there. 
This left cell I6 with only one option: a 7. 
So she drew one there. 
Alice found that cell D6 could only contain a 8: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she placed one there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice took a deep breath. She sharpened her pencil to a point.

Alice let her thoughts drift. 
Something about the party was making her uncomfortable. She thought idly of writing. She had a recollection about her children. What was it they'd said?

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
Many of the cells remained unfilled.
This left cell G6 with only one option: a 2. 
So she put one there. 

Alice looked for the best move.
Alice found that cell G4 could only contain a 8: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She put a 8 at G4.

So she put it there. 
She found that cell D3 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she inserted it there. 
This left cell D4 with only one option: a 9. 
So she wrote it there. 
Alice found that cell E8 could only contain a 8: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully pencilled a 8 at E8. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

![....79.65469583712..5.6..933429581765...36.846.8.2.3599548126377..645.28826397541](000079065469583712005060093342958176500036084608020359954812637700645028826397541.png "....79.65469583712..5.6..933429581765...36.846.8.2.3599548126377..645.28826397541")

Alice took a deep breath. She checked her phone for notices.

Alice allowed her mind to wander. 
Muted colors filled her mind. Something about writing was making her uncomfortable. Thoughts of the news nagged at the edge of her consciousness. What was it they'd said?

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Many of the cells remained unfilled.
She found that cell E7 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She lightly put in a 2 in E7. 
This left cell H7 with only one option: a 9. 
She quickly placed in a 9. 
A quick scan of row C uncovered that cell C2 HAD to be a 7. She quickly pencilled in a 7 in C2.

She quickly added in a 9 in E2. 
This left cell E3 with only one option: a 7. 
She lightly sketched in a 7 at E3. 

She checked the puzzle again.

Alice sighed softly. She wiped off her glasses with a cloth.

Alice started to reminisce. 
Thoughts of computers nagged at the edge of her consciousness. Dreary colors filled her mind. She had a recollection about Hannah. People often told her not to focus on negative things, but it was difficult.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
She felt she was making good headway, but still had some work to do.
This left cell C6 with only one option: a 1. 
She lightly put a 1. 

She looked over the puzzle again.

Alice took a deep breath. She sharpened her pencil to a point.

Alice started to reminisce. 
Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page. She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving writing. She thought idly of the party. Her mind called up images of her children.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
She was getting quite close to a solution!
This left cell F4 with only one option: a 7. 
So she sketched one there. 

Alice scanned the puzzle again.
This left cell H2 with only one option: a 3.

So she inserted it there. 
Alice stopped. The puzzle was completely filled.

### Solution

Alice paused to reflect on the problem she had just solved. 
This Sudoku was very straightforward, and she felt it was not difficult at all. 
She hoped the next problem would provide more of a challenge. Easy puzzles could be boring sometimes.

Alice checked the time again, wondering if there was time for another puzzle.

## Nightmare #1
*Fri Jun  9 03:48:39 2017*

Alice and her mother travelled to the Food Court on a train.
Powerful feelings of worry washed over her.
Intense emotions of fright washed over her.
They were being pursued by a wild monster.
Things were odd.
They were being pursued by a shadowy figure.
The directions was broken.
They were being chased by a fierce ghost.
The route was clouded.
They were being attacked by a frightening ghost.
She needed to attain a dark carton of ice cream.
Alice and her mother continued on to the Food Court.
There was a cookie jar she found intriguing.
They were being hunted by a shadowy animal.
The directions was confounding.
She could not feel the way forward.
There was a sponge she wanted.
She could escape her situation.
The way forward was broken.
They were being attacked by a frightening spirit.
Things were out of place.
She needed to hide a dark bowl.
They were being pursued by a fierce animal.
They arrived at the Food Court.

Alice wondered what it all meant.

Alice sharpened her pencil to a point. She took a deep breath.

Alice allowed her mind to wander. 
She thought idly of the party. Faded colors filled her mind. Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page. Something about Hannah was making her uncomfortable.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.

Alice wiped off her glasses with a cloth. She brushed the hair away from her eyes.

Alice started to reminisce. 
She thought idly of her children. She had a recollection about computers. Thinking about her children usually soothed her, but... She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving work.

Alice brushed the hair away from her eyes. She checked her phone for notices.

Alice let her thoughts drift. 
She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving Bob. Something about Bob was making her uncomfortable. Thoughts of the news nagged at the edge of her consciousness. Dreary colors filled her mind.

Alice took a sip of her coffee. She wiped off her glasses with a cloth.

Alice began to daydream. 
She had a recollection about writing. She was troubled about computers. Her mind called up images of Bob. Something about work was making her uncomfortable.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
She felt she was making good headway, but still had some work to do.
Alice found that cell C1 could only contain a 8: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she drew it there.

Alice wiped off her glasses with a cloth. She sharpened her pencil to a point.

Alice began to daydream. 
Thoughts of computers nagged at the edge of her consciousness. Drab colors filled her mind. Thinking about her children usually soothed her, but... People often told her not to focus on negative things, but it was difficult.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
She was getting quite close to a solution!
This left cell H5 with only one option: a 7. 
She lightly added a 7. 
This left cell H1 with only one option: a 6. 
She quickly wrote a 6 in H1. 

She checked the puzzle again.

Alice paused to reflect on the problem she had just finished. 
This Sudoku was very straightforward, and she felt it was very easy. 
She hoped the next problem would provide more of a challenge. Easy puzzles could be boring sometimes.

Alice checked the time again, wondering if there was time for another puzzle.

## Puzzle #3
*Mon Aug 28 06:57:42 2017*

![..3....5....1....9..6...3.........8.4....1....7.982..42........9...48.3..4.5....6](003000050000100009006000300000000080400001000070982004200000000900048030040500006.png "..3....5....1....9..6...3.........8.4....1....7.982..42........9...48.3..4.5....6")

Alice resumed looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
Row F had a cell F1 which, she discovered, could only hold a 3. So she etched it there. 
Column 2 had a cell G2 which, Alice determined, could only hold a 3. So she etched it there. 
There was really only one cell for a 4 on column 3, and that was cell B3. She carefully drew a 4. 
There was only one square for a 6 on column 1 - cell D1. So she put it there. 
There was clearly only one choice for a 6 on column 2: cell H2. So she put one there. 
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position A'.

### Position A

![..3....5...41....9..6...3..6......8.4....1...37.982..423.......96..48.3..4.5....6](003000050004100009006000300600000080400001000370982004230000000960048030040500006.png "..3....5...41....9..6...3..6......8.4....1...37.982..423.......96..48.3..4.5....6")

Alice considered her next move. She compiled the shortest list of options. From here, she could 
place a 1 in F3, 
or place a 5 in F3. 
Alice decided to try putting a 1 into cell F3.

Alice began looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
She found that cell F8 could only contain a 6: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she put it there. 

Again she checked for a move.
This left cell F7 with only one option: a 5. 
So she put it there. 
There was obviously only one cell for a 1 on box 7 - cell I1. So she inserted one there. 
There was only one choice for a 1 on column 5: cell G5. She quickly etched a 1 at G5. 

Alice checked the puzzle again.
There was really only one option for a 1 on column 8: cell C8. She lightly drew a 1 at C8. 
Row A included a cell A2 which, Alice discovered, could only be a 1. She lightly pencilled in a 1 at A2. 
A quick review of column 8 uncovered that cell G8 definitely was a 4. So she added it there. 
A careful scan through column 7 showed that cell A7 definitely must be a 4. So she etched one there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

![.13...45...41....9..6...31.6......8.4....1...37198256423..1..4.96..48.3.14.5....6](013000450004100009006000310600000080400001000371982564230010040960048030140500006.png ".13...45...41....9..6...31.6......8.4....1...37198256423..1..4.96..48.3.14.5....6")

Alice studied the puzzle intently. She checked her phone for notices.

Alice started to reminisce. 
Something about writing was making her uncomfortable. Thoughts of the news nagged at the edge of her consciousness. She was troubled about Bob. She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving writing.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.

She scanned the puzzle carefully.
A search of column 7 showed that cell B7 surely HAD to be a 6. So she inserted it there. 

She reviewed the puzzle again.
There was really only one square for a 9 on box 1: cell C2. She lightly inserted a 9 at C2. 

She scanned for the best move.
There was obviously only one option for a 2 on box 1: cell B2. She carefully pencilled in a 2 in B2. 

Alice scanned for the best move.
This left cell B8 with only one option: a 7. 
She carefully sketched in a 7 at B8. 
This left cell D2 with only one option: a 5. 
She lightly pencilled in a 5 at D2. 

Once again she checked for a cell.
This left cell E2 with only one option: a 8. 
So she drew one there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

![.13...45..241..679.96...31.65.....8.48...1...37198256423..1..4.96..48.3.14.5....6](013000450024100679096000310650000080480001000371982564230010040960048030140500006.png ".13...45..241..679.96...31.65.....8.48...1...37198256423..1..4.96..48.3.14.5....6")

Alice sharpened her pencil to a point. She took a deep breath.

Alice let her thoughts drift. 
She had a recollection about writing. What was it they'd said? People often told her not to focus on negative things, but it was difficult. She thought idly of Bob.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.
Row E had a cell E5 which, Alice figured, could only hold a 5. So she placed it there. 
She found that cell B5 could only contain a 3: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she wrote it there. 
This left cell B6 with only one option: a 5. 
So she placed one there. 
Alice found that cell B1 could only contain a 8: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully etched a 8 at B1. 
Alice found that cell A1 could only contain a 7: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she pencilled it there. 

Alice looked over the puzzle carefully.
This left cell C1 with only one option: a 5. 
So she placed one there. 
This left cell D5 with only one option: a 7. 
So she sketched it there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice checked her phone for notices. She sharpened her pencil to a point.

Alice began to daydream. 
She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving her children. Her mind called up images of computers. Thinking about the news usually soothed her, but... Thoughts of her children nagged at the edge of her consciousness.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.
She found that cell C5 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she drew it there. 
This left cell C9 with only one option: a 8.

This left cell A9 with only one option: a 2. 
She lightly inserted a 2. 
This left cell I5 with only one option: a 9. 
So she sketched one there. 
Alice found that cell A5 could only contain a 6: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She sketched a 6 in A5.

Alice sighed softly. She checked her phone for notices.

Alice began to daydream. 
Thinking about computers usually soothed her, but... She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving Bob. Something about computers was making her uncomfortable. Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
Many of the cells remained unfilled.
She found that cell A4 could only contain a 8: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She etched a 8 in A4. 
She found that cell A6 could only contain a 9: all other digits were blocked somehow.

Alice checked her phone for notices. She took a sip of her coffee.

Alice began to daydream. 
She thought idly of work. Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page. She had a recollection about writing. People often told her not to focus on negative things, but it was difficult.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Many of the cells remained unfilled.

Alice looked over the puzzle carefully.
She found that cell E9 could only contain a 3: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She quickly drew in a 3. 

She scanned for the next move.
Alice found that cell D9 could only contain a 1: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully etched a 1 at D9. 

Again she checked for a move.
This left cell D7 with only one option: a 2.

Alice studied the puzzle intently. She checked her phone for notices.

Alice let her thoughts drift. 
She thought idly of computers. Thoughts of Bob nagged at the edge of her consciousness. Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page. Something about Bob was making her uncomfortable.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
She felt she was making good headway, but still had some work to do.
She found that cell D6 could only contain a 4: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she placed it there. 
Alice found that cell G6 could only contain a 6: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she wrote it there. 

She reviewed the puzzle again.
This left cell G9 with only one option: a 5. 
She quickly sketched a 5. 
She found that cell G3 could only contain a 8: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She quickly etched a 8. 

Alice looked over the puzzle again.
This left cell G7 with only one option: a 9. 
She lightly sketched in a 9 at G7. 
This left cell H4 with only one option: a 2. 
She etched in a 2 in H4. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice sharpened her pencil to a point. She took a deep breath.

Alice began to daydream. 
She thought idly of writing. She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving computers. Something about writing was making her uncomfortable. People often told her not to focus on negative things, but it was difficult.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
She was getting quite close to a solution!
She found that cell H7 could only contain a 1: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she pencilled one there. 
She found that cell H9 could only contain a 7: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she placed it there. 

She checked the puzzle again.
Alice found that cell H3 could only contain a 5: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she etched one there. 

Once again Alice checked for a cell.
This left cell I3 with only one option: a 7. 
She lightly put a 7 in I3. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice checked her phone for notices. She wiped off her glasses with a cloth.

Alice began to daydream. 
She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving the news. Her mind called up images of the news. Drab colors filled her mind. She thought idly of work.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
She was getting quite close to a solution!
This left cell I6 with only one option: a 3. 
She quickly sketched a 3. 
She found that cell I7 could only contain a 8: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She quickly etched in a 8 at I7. 
Alice stopped. The puzzle was completely filled.

### Solution

Alice took a moment to review the problem she had just solved. 
This Sudoku layout was somewhat more complicated, and she felt it was tricky. 
Her guesses were fortunate, though... she didn't have to erase very much to find the solution. 
Maybe the next problem would be even more difficult!

Alice checked the time again, wondering if there was time for another puzzle.

## Puzzle #4
*Mon Aug 28 07:09:22 2017*

Alice resumed looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
There was obviously only one option for a 1 on column 9, and that was cell B9. So she inserted one there. 
There was really only one home for a 5 on column 2: cell B2. So she added it there. 

She checked the puzzle again.
Column 8 had a cell F8 which, Alice discovered, could only hold a 6. So she etched one there. 

Again she checked for a move.
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position B'.

### Position B

![.7..8.946.5....3.1..6.....5...4.6.........7195.3..7.6..9..23...2.5..46........1..](070080946050000301006000005000406000000000719503007060090023000205004600000000100.png ".7..8.946.5....3.1..6.....5...4.6.........7195.3..7.6..9..23...2.5..46........1..")

Alice considered her next move. She compiled the shortest list of options. From here, she could 
place a 1 in A1, 
or place a 3 in A1. 
Alice decided to try putting a 1 into cell A1.

Alice began looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 

Again she checked for a cell.
This left cell A3 with only one option: a 2. 
She carefully sketched in a 2 at A3. 

Once again Alice checked for a cell.
This left cell A6 with only one option: a 5. 
She quickly placed a 5 in A6. 

Alice scanned the puzzle carefully.
Alice found that cell A4 could only contain a 3: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she pencilled one there. 
A thorough review of column 6 revealed that cell C6 was a 1. She carefully drew in a 1 in C6. 

Alice looked for the best move.
There was really only one square for a 3 on row E, and that was cell E5. She carefully wrote a 3 at E5. 
There was clearly only one location for a 5 on row E, and that was cell E4. So she wrote one there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice wiped off her glasses with a cloth. She sighed softly.

Alice let her thoughts drift. 
She thought idly of the news. She was troubled about the news. Thinking about Bob usually soothed her, but... Her mind called up images of computers.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.
A thorough scan of column 5 showed that cell I5 definitely was a 5. So she inserted one there. 

Alice scanned the puzzle carefully.
A thorough check through column 5 showed that cell B5 absolutely HAD to be a 6. She quickly pencilled a 6 in B5. 

She scanned for the best move.
There was obviously only one square for a 4 on column 5: cell C5. So she wrote one there. 
A check through column 5 showed that cell H5 was a 7. She lightly placed in a 7 at H5. 
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position C'.

### Position C

Alice considered her next move. She compiled the shortest list of options. From here, she could 
place a 2 in B6, 
or place a 9 in B6. 
Alice decided to try putting a 2 into cell B6.

Alice started looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
Alice found that cell E6 could only contain a 8: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully put a 8 at E6. 
She found that cell E3 could only contain a 4: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she placed one there. 
Alice found that cell E1 could only contain a 6: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully wrote in a 6 in E1. 
She found that cell E2 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she drew it there. 
She found that cell I6 could only contain a 9: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she drew it there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice studied the puzzle intently. She sharpened her pencil to a point.

Alice allowed her mind to wander. 
What was it they'd said? Dreary colors filled her mind. Her mind called up images of the party. Thoughts of the party nagged at the edge of her consciousness.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.

Alice looked over the puzzle again.
Column 4 had a cell F4 which, Alice discovered, could only hold a 2. So she added it there. 
There was really only one location for a 4 on row B, and that was cell B1. She lightly etched a 4 in B1. 
A thorough check of column 2 uncovered that cell I2 absolutely was a 4. So she sketched it there. 
There was obviously only one choice for a 6 on row G: cell G4. So she inserted one there. 
This left cell I4 with only one option: a 8. 
She lightly added in a 8 in I4. 

Once again she checked for a cell.
Alice found that cell H4 could only contain a 1: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She quickly inserted in a 1 at H4. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice sharpened her pencil to a point. She sighed softly.

Alice began to daydream. 
Her mind called up images of the news. She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving work. She was troubled about Hannah. Something about the party was making her uncomfortable.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.
She found that cell I3 could only contain a 7: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she placed it there. 

She looked for the next move.
This left cell G1 with only one option: a 8. 
She lightly sketched a 8. 
She found that cell G3 could only contain a 1: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she put one there. 

Again Alice checked for a cell.
This left cell H2 with only one option: a 3. 
So she etched it there. 
Alice realized she had reached a dead end. There were no more squares she could fill, and no more moves to try.

Alice sighed, then erased her work, until the board once again matched [position C](#position-C).

Alice decided to try putting a 9 into cell B6.

Alice began looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
Alice found that cell I6 could only contain a 8: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She quickly drew in a 8 in I6. 
She found that cell E6 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She lightly placed a 2. 
There was obviously only one choice for a 8 on column 4 - cell F4. So she drew one there. 

Alice scanned for the best move.
Row C had a cell C1 which, Alice realized, could only be a 9. She drew in a 9 at C1. 
There was only one cell for a 3 on row C - cell C2. So she etched it there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice sharpened her pencil to a point. She took a sip of her coffee.

Alice let her thoughts drift. 
Faded colors filled her mind. What was it they'd said? People often told her not to focus on negative things, but it was difficult. Something about work was making her uncomfortable.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.
Column 1 contained a cell I1 which, she discovered, could only contain a 3. So she placed it there. 
There was really only one home for a 9 on row F - cell F5. So she placed it there. 

She looked for the next move.
She found that cell D5 could only contain a 1: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully etched in a 1 in D5. 
Row F contained a cell F2 which, Alice discovered, could only be a 1. She carefully placed in a 1 in F2. 
This left cell H2 with only one option: a 8. 
So she pencilled it there. 

Once again she checked for a cell.

Alice brushed the hair away from her eyes. She took a sip of her coffee.

Alice began to daydream. 
Thoughts of work nagged at the edge of her consciousness. Thinking about writing usually soothed her, but... Her mind called up images of the party. Dreary colors filled her mind.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
Many of the cells remained unfilled.
This left cell H8 with only one option: a 9. 
She quickly sketched a 9 in H8. 
She found that cell H4 could only contain a 1: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she placed it there. 
Alice found that cell G4 could only contain a 6: all other digits were blocked somehow.

Alice studied the puzzle intently. She wiped off her glasses with a cloth.

Alice started to reminisce. 
Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page. Her mind called up images of writing. What was it they'd said? People often told her not to focus on negative things, but it was difficult.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
Many of the cells remained unfilled.

Alice checked the puzzle carefully.
This left cell B1 with only one option: a 8. 
So she etched it there. 

She looked for the next move.
This left cell B3 with only one option: a 4. 
So she wrote it there. 
She found that cell E1 could only contain a 6: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully pencilled in a 6. 
This left cell E2 with only one option: a 4. 
So she wrote it there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice brushed the hair away from her eyes. She took a deep breath.

Alice began to daydream. 
She had a recollection about the news. People often told her not to focus on negative things, but it was difficult. She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving Hannah. Thinking about her children usually soothed her, but...

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
She felt she was making good headway, but still had some work to do.
This left cell E3 with only one option: a 8. 
She lightly inserted in a 8. 
This left cell G7 with only one option: a 8. 
She carefully added a 8 in G7. 
She found that cell C7 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She lightly wrote a 2 at C7. 
She found that cell B8 could only contain a 7: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She quickly sketched a 7 at B8. 

Once again Alice checked for a move.
Alice found that cell B4 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She quickly inserted in a 2 in B4. 
This left cell C4 with only one option: a 7. 
She carefully wrote in a 7 in C4. 
She found that cell C8 could only contain a 8: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully wrote a 8. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice gazed out the window at the rising sun. She checked her phone for notices.

Alice allowed her mind to wander. 
Thinking about computers usually soothed her, but... She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving computers. Thoughts of the news nagged at the edge of her consciousness. What was it they'd said?

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
She felt she was making good headway, but still had some work to do.

She looked over the puzzle again.
This left cell F7 with only one option: a 4. 
So she sketched one there. 
This left cell F9 with only one option: a 2. 
So she sketched one there. 

Again she checked for a move.
This left cell G8 with only one option: a 5. 
So she wrote one there. 

Again Alice checked for a cell.
She found that cell G9 could only contain a 7: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she wrote it there. 
Alice found that cell G3 could only contain a 1: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully inserted in a 1 at G3. 
This left cell I2 with only one option: a 6. 
She carefully put a 6 in I2. 
This left cell I3 with only one option: a 7. 
So she placed it there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice took a sip of her coffee. She gazed out the window at the rising sun.

Alice let her thoughts drift. 
She had a recollection about computers. Thinking about Hannah usually soothed her, but... She was troubled about the news. Thoughts of the party nagged at the edge of her consciousness.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
She was getting quite close to a solution!
Alice found that cell I4 could only contain a 9: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she pencilled one there. 
She found that cell I8 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she put it there. 
This left cell I9 with only one option: a 4. 
So she sketched it there. 
Alice stopped. The puzzle was completely filled.

### Solution

Alice stopped to review the puzzle she had just finished. 
This Sudoku layout was somewhat more complicated, and she felt it was tricky. 
Her guesses were fortunate, though... she didn't have to erase very much to find the solution. 
Maybe the next problem would be even more difficult!

Alice checked the time again, wondering if there was time for another puzzle.

## Puzzle #5
*Mon Aug 28 07:22:57 2017*

![..2.7.4...8.....3....1.9.........1.652...7......82...3....5..7...64....5..4...69.](002070400080000030000109000000000106520007000000820003000050070006400005004000690.png "..2.7.4...8.....3....1.9.........1.652...7......82...3....5..7...64....5..4...69.")

Alice resumed looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
Row D included a cell D8 which, she reasoned, could only hold a 2. She carefully sketched a 2 at D8. 

She checked the puzzle again.
There was really only one home for a 4 on row G: cell G9. So she sketched one there. 
Row I had a cell I2 which, she reasoned, could only be a 5. So she added it there. 
Column 4 had a cell I4 which, Alice realized, could only be a 7. She quickly added in a 7 at I4. 
There was only one square for a 7 on box 6 - cell F7. So she pencilled it there. 
A thorough review through box 6 uncovered that cell F8 definitely was a 5. She carefully drew a 5. 
There was obviously only one choice for a 4 on column 8: cell E8. She carefully put in a 4 at E8. 

Alice checked the puzzle carefully.
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position D'.

### Position D

![..2.7.4...8.....3....1.9.........12652...7.4....82.753....5..74..64....5.547..69.](002070400080000030000109000000000126520007040000820753000050074006400005054700690.png "..2.7.4...8.....3....1.9.........12652...7.4....82.753....5..74..64....5.547..69.")

Alice considered her next move. She compiled the shortest list of options. From here, she could 
place a 4 in B5, 
or place a 6 in B5. 
Alice decided to try putting a 4 into cell B5.

Alice continued looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position E'.

### Position E

![..2.7.4...8..4..3....1.9.........12652...7.4....82.753....5..74..64....5.547..69.](002070400080040030000109000000000126520007040000820753000050074006400005054700690.png "..2.7.4...8..4..3....1.9.........12652...7.4....82.753....5..74..64....5.547..69.")

Alice considered her next move. She compiled the shortest list of options. From here, she could 
place a 6 in C8, 
or place a 8 in C8. 
Alice decided to try putting a 6 into cell C8.

Alice started looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
There was clearly only one option for a 6 on column 5, and that was cell E5. She etched in a 6. 
A thorough review through row E revealed that cell E3 surely HAD to be a 1. So she inserted it there. 
She found that cell F3 could only contain a 9: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she inserted it there. 
There was clearly only one option for a 1 on row F, and that was cell F6. So she placed it there. 
Row E included a cell E4 which, she realized, could only hold a 3. She lightly pencilled in a 3 at E4. 

Alice looked over the puzzle again.
This left cell D5 with only one option: a 9. 
She quickly sketched a 9. 
Alice found that cell D4 could only contain a 5: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She lightly put in a 5 at D4. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

![..2.7.4...8..4..3....1.9.6....59.126521367.4...9821753....5..74..64....5.547..69.](002070400080040030000109060000590126521367040009821753000050074006400005054700690.png "..2.7.4...8..4..3....1.9.6....59.126521367.4...9821753....5..74..64....5.547..69.")

Alice sighed softly. She gazed out the window at the rising sun.

Alice allowed her mind to wander. 
Something about her children was making her uncomfortable. Her mind called up images of Hannah. Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page. Muted colors filled her mind.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.
She found that cell A4 could only contain a 6: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully put in a 6 at A4. 
This left cell B4 with only one option: a 2. 
So she wrote it there. 
This left cell B6 with only one option: a 5. 
So she put it there. 

Again she checked for a cell.
Alice found that cell B3 could only contain a 7: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she wrote it there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

![..267.4...87245.3....1.9.6....59.126521367.4...9821753....5..74..64....5.547..69.](002670400087245030000109060000590126521367040009821753000050074006400005054700690.png "..267.4...87245.3....1.9.6....59.126521367.4...9821753....5..74..64....5.547..69.")

Alice took a deep breath. She took a sip of her coffee.

Alice started to reminisce. 
She had a recollection about Bob. What was it they'd said? She thought idly of work. Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.

She looked for the best move.
This left cell B7 with only one option: a 9. 
So she etched one there. 
She found that cell B9 could only contain a 1: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She lightly placed a 1. 
Alice found that cell A8 could only contain a 8: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she pencilled one there. 
Alice realized she had reached a dead end. There were no more squares she could fill, and no more moves to try.

Alice sighed, then erased her work, until the board once again matched [position E](#position-E).

Alice decided to try putting a 8 into cell C8.

Alice continued looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
She found that cell H8 could only contain a 1: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she etched it there. 
This left cell A8 with only one option: a 6. 
So she wrote it there. 
There was clearly only one spot for a 8 on row A, and that was cell A6. So she pencilled one there. 
There was clearly only one spot for a 5 on row A, and that was cell A4. She pencilled in a 5. 
There was really only one choice for a 3 on box 2: cell C5. She etched a 3 at C5. 
Alice found that cell D5 could only contain a 9: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she inserted one there. 
This left cell D4 with only one option: a 3. 
She lightly put in a 3. 
This left cell E4 with only one option: a 6. 
She lightly put in a 6 at E4. 

Again Alice checked for a cell.
This left cell B4 with only one option: a 2. 
She inserted a 2 at B4. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

![..257846..8.24..3....139.8....39.12652.6.7.4....82.753....5..74..64...15.547..69.](002578460080240030000139080000390126520607040000820753000050074006400015054700690.png "..257846..8.24..3....139.8....39.12652.6.7.4....82.753....5..74..64...15.547..69.")

Alice wiped off her glasses with a cloth. She checked her phone for notices.

Alice let her thoughts drift. 
Her mind called up images of work. She thought idly of Hannah. What was it they'd said? Thoughts of her children nagged at the edge of her consciousness.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.

Alice reviewed the puzzle carefully.
Alice found that cell B6 could only contain a 6: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She quickly sketched a 6. 
This left cell E5 with only one option: a 1. 
She lightly wrote in a 1. 
This left cell F6 with only one option: a 4. 
So she wrote one there. 
She found that cell D6 could only contain a 5: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she etched one there. 
She found that cell G4 could only contain a 9: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she wrote one there. 
This left cell H5 with only one option: a 8. 
She lightly sketched in a 8 at H5. 
Alice realized she had reached a dead end. There were no more squares she could fill, and no more moves to try.

Alice sighed, then erased her work, until the board once again matched [position E](#position-E).

Alice sighed, then erased her work, until the board once again matched [position D](#position-D).

Alice decided to try putting a 6 into cell B5.

Alice started looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
There was really only one choice for a 6 on row E, and that was cell E4. She quickly wrote a 6 at E4. 
A careful search through row G uncovered that cell G6 definitely must be a 6. She carefully pencilled in a 6. 
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position F'.

### Position F

![..2.7.4...8..6..3....1.9.........12652.6.7.4....82.753....56.74..64....5.547..69.](002070400080060030000109000000000126520607040000820753000056074006400005054700690.png "..2.7.4...8..6..3....1.9.........12652.6.7.4....82.753....56.74..64....5.547..69.")

Alice considered her next move. She compiled the shortest list of options. From here, she could 
place a 3 in A4, 
or place a 5 in A4. 
Alice decided to try putting a 3 into cell A4.

Alice began looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
Row A contained a cell A6 which, Alice figured, could only contain a 5. So she added it there. 
Alice found that cell B4 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She lightly placed a 2 at B4. 
She found that cell B6 could only contain a 4: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she inserted it there. 
This left cell C5 with only one option: a 8. 
So she added it there. 
This left cell C8 with only one option: a 6. 
So she wrote it there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice wiped off her glasses with a cloth. She took a deep breath.

Alice allowed her mind to wander. 
She thought idly of work. Something about work was making her uncomfortable. What was it they'd said? She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving Hannah.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.
This left cell D6 with only one option: a 3. 
So she pencilled it there. 

Once again she checked for a cell.
This left cell F6 with only one option: a 1. 
She added in a 1 in F6. 
This left cell E5 with only one option: a 9. 
So she sketched one there. 
This left cell D4 with only one option: a 5. 
So she put one there. 
Alice found that cell D5 could only contain a 4: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she added it there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice took a deep breath. She wiped off her glasses with a cloth.

Alice started to reminisce. 
She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving computers. Thoughts of the party nagged at the edge of her consciousness. Faded colors filled her mind. She had a recollection about Bob.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.
This left cell E7 with only one option: a 8. 
So she etched it there. 
Alice realized she had reached a dead end. There were no more squares she could fill, and no more moves to try.

Alice sighed, then erased her work, until the board once again matched [position F](#position-F).

Alice decided to try putting a 5 into cell A4.

Alice reviewed the puzzle carefully.
This left cell B4 with only one option: a 2. 
She carefully sketched in a 2 at B4. 
This left cell B6 with only one option: a 4. 
She quickly drew in a 4 at B6. 
This left cell F6 with only one option: a 1. 
So she placed one there. 

Once again Alice checked for a move.
She found that cell F3 could only contain a 9: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she added it there. 
A careful check through row E uncovered that cell E3 surely must be a 1. She carefully put a 1. 
Row E had a cell E5 which, she figured, could only contain a 3. So she sketched one there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice studied the puzzle intently. She took a deep breath.

Alice began to daydream. 
She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving Bob. People often told her not to focus on negative things, but it was difficult. Her mind called up images of the news. Thinking about writing usually soothed her, but...

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.
She found that cell C5 could only contain a 8: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She lightly sketched a 8 at C5.

Once again Alice checked for a move.
Alice found that cell D6 could only contain a 5: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully put a 5 at D6. 

Alice scanned for the best move.
This left cell G4 with only one option: a 3. 
So she sketched it there.

So she placed one there. 
She found that cell G7 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She lightly put in a 2 in G7.

Alice checked her phone for notices. She gazed out the window at the rising sun.

Alice allowed her mind to wander. 
She had a recollection about computers. Muted colors filled her mind. Thoughts of computers nagged at the edge of her consciousness. Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Many of the cells remained unfilled.
She found that cell H7 could only contain a 3: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She quickly etched in a 3 at H7. 
This left cell I5 with only one option: a 1. 
So she pencilled it there.

Alice took a sip of her coffee. She brushed the hair away from her eyes.

Alice started to reminisce. 
She thought idly of computers. Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page. Her mind called up images of Hannah. She was troubled about Bob.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Many of the cells remained unfilled.
Alice found that cell B1 could only contain a 1: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully sketched in a 1 at B1. 

She looked for the next move.
This left cell B3 with only one option: a 5. 
She quickly placed in a 5. 
This left cell C9 with only one option: a 2. 
She carefully placed a 2 in C9. 
Alice found that cell G1 could only contain a 9: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She lightly drew in a 9. 
She found that cell A1 could only contain a 6: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She drew in a 6 in A1. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice sighed softly. She brushed the hair away from her eyes.

Alice allowed her mind to wander. 
Thinking about the news usually soothed her, but... Drab colors filled her mind. She had a recollection about computers. She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving the news.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
She felt she was making good headway, but still had some work to do.
This left cell A2 with only one option: a 9. 
So she etched it there. 
She found that cell F1 could only contain a 4: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she etched it there. 
This left cell F2 with only one option: a 6. 
She put in a 6. 

She scanned for the best move.
Alice found that cell G2 could only contain a 1: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she placed one there. 

Again Alice checked for a cell.
This left cell H2 with only one option: a 7. 
She inserted in a 7 at H2. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice took a sip of her coffee. She sharpened her pencil to a point.

Alice began to daydream. 
She thought idly of the party. Her mind called up images of computers. She had a recollection about computers. She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving work.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
She felt she was making good headway, but still had some work to do.

She scanned for the best move.
Alice found that cell D2 could only contain a 3: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She etched in a 3. 

She checked the puzzle again.
This left cell C2 with only one option: a 4. 
She pencilled in a 4 in C2. 

She scanned for the next move.
This left cell D3 with only one option: a 7. 
So she put it there. 
She found that cell C3 could only contain a 3: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She sketched in a 3 at C3. 
Alice found that cell C1 could only contain a 7: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She sketched a 7 at C1.

Alice took a sip of her coffee. She gazed out the window at the rising sun.

Alice allowed her mind to wander. 
Her mind called up images of her children. Something about work was making her uncomfortable. Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page. Thoughts of writing nagged at the edge of her consciousness.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
She was getting quite close to a solution!
Alice found that cell H1 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she pencilled one there. 
This left cell H6 with only one option: a 8.

Alice took a sip of her coffee. She brushed the hair away from her eyes.

Alice allowed her mind to wander. 
People often told her not to focus on negative things, but it was difficult. What was it they'd said? Something about writing was making her uncomfortable. Thoughts of Hannah nagged at the edge of her consciousness.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
She was getting quite close to a solution!

She looked for the best move.
Alice found that cell I6 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she added it there. 
Alice stopped. The puzzle was completely filled.

### Solution

![692573481185264937743189562837945126521637849469821753918356274276498315354712698](692573481185264937743189562837945126521637849469821753918356274276498315354712698.png "692573481185264937743189562837945126521637849469821753918356274276498315354712698")

Alice took a moment to consider the problem she had just finished. 
This Sudoku layout was somewhat more complicated, and she felt it was tricky. 
All that backtracking made it frustrating, too. Alice had made made a mess of her paper by erasing so many things. Still, she was pleased with the end result.
Maybe the next problem would be even more difficult!

Alice checked the time again, wondering if there was time for another puzzle.

## Puzzle #6
*Mon Aug 28 07:37:39 2017*

Alice continued looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
A thorough search of row F revealed that cell F5 surely was a 6. So she drew one there. 

Again she checked for a move.
A quick check of column 5 revealed that cell E5 HAD to be a 3. So she added it there. 

Alice scanned the puzzle carefully.
There was obviously only one home for a 9 on row I: cell I2. So she placed it there. 

She looked over the puzzle carefully.
Column 8 had a cell B8 which, she realized, could only be a 9. She lightly put a 9. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

![...6...5....3...9..2..947..6.9..23.8.1..3..26....6..4.3....6..9..89.3...49.27....](000600050000300090020094700609002308010030026000060040300006009008903000490270000.png "...6...5....3...9..2..947..6.9..23.8.1..3..26....6..4.3....6..9..89.3...49.27....")

Alice took a deep breath. She took a sip of her coffee.

Alice allowed her mind to wander. 
Muted colors filled her mind. She had a recollection about work. She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving the party. Thinking about work usually soothed her, but...

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.
There was only one option for a 9 on row A - cell A1. So she drew one there. 
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position G'.

### Position G

![9..6...5....3...9..2..947..6.9..23.8.1..3..26....6..4.3....6..9..89.3...49.27....](900600050000300090020094700609002308010030026000060040300006009008903000490270000.png "9..6...5....3...9..2..947..6.9..23.8.1..3..26....6..4.3....6..9..89.3...49.27....")

Alice considered her next move. She compiled the shortest list of options. From here, she could 
place a 1 in C9, 
or place a 3 in C9. 
Alice decided to try putting a 1 into cell C9.

Alice started looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position H'.

### Position H

![9..6...5....3...9..2..947.16.9..23.8.1..3..26....6..4.3....6..9..89.3...49.27....](900600050000300090020094701609002308010030026000060040300006009008903000490270000.png "9..6...5....3...9..2..947.16.9..23.8.1..3..26....6..4.3....6..9..89.3...49.27....")

Alice considered her next move. She compiled the shortest list of options. From here, she could 
place a 2 in B9, 
or place a 4 in B9. 
Alice decided to try putting a 2 into cell B9.

Alice continued looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
Row A included a cell A5 which, she realized, could only hold a 2. So she pencilled one there. 
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position I'.

## Puzzle #7
*Mon Aug 28 07:49:53 2017*

![86.....2495.2.......2.3.......8.6.7....9.7.624....3.........9..5......186...89.4.](860000024950200000002030000000806070000907062400003000000000900500000018600089040.png "86.....2495.2.......2.3.......8.6.7....9.7.624....3.........9..5......186...89.4.")

Alice resumed looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 

She reviewed the puzzle carefully.
A search through row F revealed that cell F3 definitely HAD to be a 6. She lightly sketched a 6. 
A quick search of row F uncovered that cell F2 was a 7. So she sketched it there. 
Row F included a cell F5 which, Alice reasoned, could only hold a 2. She lightly placed in a 2. 
A thorough check through row A showed that cell A5 definitely HAD to be a 9. She lightly pencilled in a 9 in A5. 
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position L'.

### Position L

![86..9..2495.2.......2.3.......8.6.7....9.7.62476.23.........9..5......186...89.4.](860090024950200000002030000000806070000907062476023000000000900500000018600089040.png "86..9..2495.2.......2.3.......8.6.7....9.7.62476.23.........9..5......186...89.4.")

Alice considered her next move. She compiled the shortest list of options. From here, she could 
place a 1 in A6, 
or place a 5 in A6. 
Alice decided to try putting a 1 into cell A6.

Alice began looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 

Once again she checked for a cell.
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position M'.

### Position M

![86..91.2495.2.......2.3.......8.6.7....9.7.62476.23.........9..5......186...89.4.](860091024950200000002030000000806070000907062476023000000000900500000018600089040.png "86..91.2495.2.......2.3.......8.6.7....9.7.62476.23.........9..5......186...89.4.")

Alice considered her next move. She compiled the shortest list of options. From here, she could 
place a 3 in A3, 
or place a 7 in A3. 
Alice decided to try putting a 3 into cell A3.

Alice began looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 

Once again Alice checked for a move.
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position N'.

### Position N

![863.91.2495.2.......2.3.......8.6.7....9.7.62476.23.........9..5......186...89.4.](863091024950200000002030000000806070000907062476023000000000900500000018600089040.png "863.91.2495.2.......2.3.......8.6.7....9.7.62476.23.........9..5......186...89.4.")

Alice considered her next move. She compiled the shortest list of options. From here, she could 
place a 5 in A4, 
or place a 7 in A4. 
Alice decided to try putting a 5 into cell A4.

Alice continued looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
This left cell A7 with only one option: a 7. 
So she inserted one there. 
This left cell F4 with only one option: a 1. 
She etched a 1 in F4. 
Column 5 included a cell G5 which, she determined, could only hold a 1. She quickly inserted in a 1. 

Alice scanned the puzzle again.
There was clearly only one choice for a 5 on column 6 - cell G6. So she put it there. 
This left cell G8 with only one option: a 3. 
She carefully added a 3 in G8. 

She scanned for the next move.
This left cell B8 with only one option: a 8. 
So she sketched it there. 
She found that cell B6 could only contain a 4: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she drew one there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

![86359172495.2.4.8...2.3.......8.6.7....9.7.62476123.......1593.5......186...89.4.](863591724950204080002030000000806070000907062476123000000015930500000018600089040.png "86359172495.2.4.8...2.3.......8.6.7....9.7.62476123.......1593.5......186...89.4.")

Alice took a deep breath. She sharpened her pencil to a point.

Alice allowed her mind to wander. 
Something about computers was making her uncomfortable. What was it they'd said? She thought idly of the party. People often told her not to focus on negative things, but it was difficult.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.
Alice found that cell C6 could only contain a 8: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She quickly put a 8 in C6. 
Alice found that cell H6 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she inserted it there. 
This left cell H7 with only one option: a 6. 
So she added one there. 
This left cell G9 with only one option: a 7. 
She quickly etched a 7. 
Alice found that cell G1 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She lightly etched a 2 in G1. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

![86359172495.2.4.8...2.38......8.6.7....9.7.62476123...2...159375....26186...89.4.](863591724950204080002038000000806070000907062476123000200015937500002618600089040.png "86359172495.2.4.8...2.38......8.6.7....9.7.62476123...2...159375....26186...89.4.")

Alice took a deep breath. She gazed out the window at the rising sun.

Alice allowed her mind to wander. 
She was troubled about computers. Faded colors filled her mind. What was it they'd said? She thought idly of work.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.

Again she checked for a move.
She found that cell I9 could only contain a 5: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully inserted a 5. 

Again Alice checked for a cell.
This left cell F9 with only one option: a 9. 
She carefully pencilled a 9 at F9. 
This left cell F8 with only one option: a 5. 
So she inserted one there. 
Alice found that cell C8 could only contain a 9: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she etched it there. 
Alice found that cell F7 could only contain a 8: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she wrote it there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

![86359172495.2.4.8...2.38.9....8.6.7....9.7.624761238592...159375....26186...89.45](863591724950204080002038090000806070000907062476123859200015937500002618600089045.png "86359172495.2.4.8...2.38.9....8.6.7....9.7.624761238592...159375....26186...89.45")

Alice sighed softly. She wiped off her glasses with a cloth.

Alice let her thoughts drift. 
Something about the news was making her uncomfortable. She thought idly of her children. People often told her not to focus on negative things, but it was difficult. She was troubled about computers.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.
She found that cell I7 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she pencilled it there. 

Again Alice checked for a move.
There was obviously only one cell for a 2 on row D - cell D2. So she drew it there. 
There was clearly only one square for a 4 on row C, and that was cell C2. She lightly inserted in a 4. 
Alice found that cell G2 could only contain a 8: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she put one there. 

Alice looked over the puzzle again.
This left cell G3 with only one option: a 4. 
So she wrote it there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

![86359172495.2.4.8..42.38.9..2.8.6.7....9.7.62476123859284.159375....26186...89245](863591724950204080042038090020806070000907062476123859284015937500002618600089245.png "86359172495.2.4.8..42.38.9..2.8.6.7....9.7.62476123859284.159375....26186...89245")

Alice studied the puzzle intently. She took a sip of her coffee.

Alice let her thoughts drift. 
Something about computers was making her uncomfortable. Her mind called up images of computers. Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page. People often told her not to focus on negative things, but it was difficult.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Many of the cells remained unfilled.
She found that cell G4 could only contain a 6: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she drew one there. 
This left cell C4 with only one option: a 7. 
So she added one there. 
Alice found that cell B5 could only contain a 6: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she placed one there. 
This left cell C1 with only one option: a 1. 
She lightly inserted a 1 in C1.

Alice wiped off her glasses with a cloth. She took a deep breath.

Alice started to reminisce. 
What was it they'd said? Thinking about Bob usually soothed her, but... Thoughts of Hannah nagged at the edge of her consciousness. She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving Hannah.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Many of the cells remained unfilled.
This left cell C9 with only one option: a 6. 
So she sketched it there. 
This left cell D1 with only one option: a 3. 
She lightly placed a 3 at D1. 
Alice realized she had reached a dead end. There were no more squares she could fill, and no more moves to try.

Alice sighed, then erased her work, until the board once again matched [position N](#position-N).

Alice decided to try putting a 7 into cell A4.

Alice resumed looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
She found that cell A7 could only contain a 5: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully sketched in a 5 at A7. 
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position O'.

Alice considered her next move. She compiled the shortest list of options. From here, she could 
place a 4 in B5, 
or place a 6 in B5. 
Alice decided to try putting a 4 into cell B5.

Alice continued looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 

Alice scanned for the next move.

Alice sighed softly. She sharpened her pencil to a point.

Alice let her thoughts drift. 
Something about the news was making her uncomfortable. Thoughts of Hannah nagged at the edge of her consciousness. What was it they'd said? Thinking about the party usually soothed her, but...

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.
She found that cell F4 could only contain a 1: all other digits were blocked somehow.

Alice sharpened her pencil to a point. She brushed the hair away from her eyes.

Alice began to daydream. 
She had a recollection about work. She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving the news. She was troubled about computers. She thought idly of work.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.

Alice took a deep breath. She sharpened her pencil to a point.

Alice began to daydream. 
Her mind called up images of work. People often told her not to focus on negative things, but it was difficult. Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page. She was troubled about writing.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.
A thorough check of column 5 showed that cell G5 was a 1. She carefully pencilled a 1 in G5.

Thoughts of Hannah nagged at the edge of her consciousness. Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page. She had a recollection about Hannah. She was troubled about work.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
She felt she was making good headway, but still had some work to do.

She checked the puzzle carefully.
This left cell F9 with only one option: a 9. 
So she inserted one there. 
Alice found that cell D9 could only contain a 3: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully etched a 3 at D9. 
She found that cell H4 could only contain a 3: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she inserted it there. 
Alice found that cell H2 could only contain a 9: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She placed in a 9 at H2. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice wiped off her glasses with a cloth. She studied the puzzle intently.

Alice started to reminisce. 
She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving Bob. Something about the party was making her uncomfortable. Thoughts of writing nagged at the edge of her consciousness. Her mind called up images of computers.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
She felt she was making good headway, but still had some work to do.
This left cell D2 with only one option: a 1. 
She lightly etched a 1 in D2. 
Alice found that cell D7 could only contain a 4: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She lightly drew a 4 at D7. 

Alice looked for the best move.
This left cell D5 with only one option: a 5. 
So she inserted one there. 

She reviewed the puzzle again.
Alice found that cell D3 could only contain a 9: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she sketched one there. 

She reviewed the puzzle again.
She found that cell E2 could only contain a 8: all other digits were blocked somehow.

She quickly placed a 5 in E3. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice studied the puzzle intently. She brushed the hair away from her eyes.

Alice allowed her mind to wander. 
Something about her children was making her uncomfortable. Thoughts of writing nagged at the edge of her consciousness. She had a recollection about her children. What was it they'd said?

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
She was getting quite close to a solution!
This left cell E5 with only one option: a 4. 
So she wrote one there. 
This left cell E7 with only one option: a 1. 
She lightly inserted a 1 at E7. 
This left cell H3 with only one option: a 4. 
So she added it there. 
This left cell I2 with only one option: a 3. 
She carefully inserted a 3. 
She found that cell I3 could only contain a 1: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She quickly put a 1 at I3. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice found that cell I7 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She wrote a 2. 
This left cell I9 with only one option: a 5.

Alice stopped. The puzzle was completely filled.

### Solution

Alice paused to think about the puzzle she had just solved. 
This Sudoku layout was somewhat more complicated, and she felt it was pretty hard. 
All that backtracking made it frustrating, too. Alice had made made a mess of her paper by erasing so many things. Still, she was pleased with the end result.
Maybe the next problem would be even more difficult!

Alice checked the time again, wondering if there was time for another puzzle.

## Puzzle #8

Alice resumed looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
Column 5 had a cell F5 which, she realized, could only be a 1. She carefully placed a 1 in F5. 

She reviewed the puzzle again.
Column 4 had a cell B4 which, she reasoned, could only hold a 6. So she sketched it there. 

She reviewed the puzzle again.
Column 7 had a cell A7 which, Alice realized, could only be a 8. She added a 8. 
A quick review through column 7 revealed that cell D7 surely HAD to be a 7. She inserted a 7. 

Alice looked for the best move.
A careful search through column 2 revealed that cell G2 was a 8. So she etched one there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

![3..14.8...7.6.354..6....9...1...67......8.2.....91.4.8.8........2...1..7..5.6..8.](300140800070603540060000900010006700000080200000910408080000000020001007005060080.png "3..14.8...7.6.354..6....9...1...67......8.2.....91.4.8.8........2...1..7..5.6..8.")

Alice sharpened her pencil to a point. She checked her phone for notices.

Alice allowed her mind to wander. 
Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page. What was it they'd said? Dreary colors filled her mind. Thoughts of her children nagged at the edge of her consciousness.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.

She scanned for the next move.
A careful search through row H uncovered that cell H4 surely must be a 8. She wrote a 8 in H4. 
Column 6 had a cell C6 which, she figured, could only be a 8. She quickly drew in a 8 in C6. 

Once again she checked for a cell.
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position Q'.

Alice considered her next move. She compiled the shortest list of options. From here, she could 
place a 5 in A2, 
or place a 9 in A2. 
Alice decided to try putting a 5 into cell A2.

Alice started looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 

She scanned for the best move.
Alice found that cell F2 could only contain a 3: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she wrote one there. 
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position R'.

### Position R

Alice considered her next move. She compiled the shortest list of options. From here, she could 
place a 2 in A3, 
or place a 9 in A3. 
Alice decided to try putting a 2 into cell A3.

Alice continued looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
She found that cell A9 could only contain a 6: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She quickly pencilled a 6 in A9. 
She found that cell A8 could only contain a 7: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully drew in a 7 in A8. 

She looked for the next move.
This left cell A6 with only one option: a 9. 
She quickly wrote in a 9 at A6. 
Alice found that cell B5 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she put one there. 
Alice found that cell B9 could only contain a 1: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She sketched a 1 at B9. 
There was really only one spot for a 1 on row E: cell E8. So she placed it there. 
There was obviously only one spot for a 6 on box 6 - cell F8. She lightly etched a 6 in F8. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice sighed softly. She sharpened her pencil to a point.

Alice began to daydream. 
What was it they'd said? Muted colors filled her mind. Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page. Thoughts of Hannah nagged at the edge of her consciousness.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.

Again she checked for a move.
This left cell F3 with only one option: a 7. 
So she wrote one there. 

Again Alice checked for a move.
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position S'.

### Position S

Alice considered her next move. She compiled the shortest list of options. From here, she could 
place a 8 in B1, 
or place a 9 in B1. 
Alice decided to try putting a 8 into cell B1.

Alice began looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
She found that cell B3 could only contain a 9: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She quickly placed in a 9 in B3. 
Row D had a cell D3 which, Alice reasoned, could only hold a 8. She added a 8 at D3. 
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position T'.

### Position T

Alice considered her next move. She compiled the shortest list of options. From here, she could 
place a 1 in C1, 
or place a 4 in C1. 
Alice decided to try putting a 1 into cell C1.

Alice began looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 

Once again Alice checked for a move.
She found that cell C3 could only contain a 4: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she wrote one there. 
She found that cell E3 could only contain a 6: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she wrote it there. 
She found that cell H3 could only contain a 3: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She etched in a 3 in H3. 
This left cell G3 with only one option: a 1. 
So she drew one there. 
Alice found that cell H7 could only contain a 6: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She quickly inserted a 6. 
This left cell G7 with only one option: a 3. 
So she drew it there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice sharpened her pencil to a point. She gazed out the window at the rising sun.

Alice allowed her mind to wander. 
Something about computers was making her uncomfortable. She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving her children. Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page. Thoughts of her children nagged at the edge of her consciousness.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.

She scanned the puzzle carefully.
Alice found that cell I7 could only contain a 1: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She lightly wrote a 1. 

Alice scanned for the next move.
A thorough review of row I revealed that cell I4 definitely must be a 3. She quickly put in a 3 in I4. 
Row E had a cell E9 which, Alice figured, could only hold a 3. So she added it there. 
This left cell C9 with only one option: a 2. 
So she drew one there. 
She found that cell C8 could only contain a 3: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She etched a 3. 
There was clearly only one location for a 2 on row I - cell I6. So she inserted one there. 

Alice scanned for the next move.
This left cell F6 with only one option: a 5. 
She carefully pencilled a 5. 

She looked for the next move.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Many of the cells remained unfilled.
Alice found that cell F1 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she sketched it there. 

Alice looked for the best move.
A quick review of row D showed that cell D4 was a 2. She lightly inserted a 2. 

Alice checked the puzzle carefully.
There was clearly only one home for a 2 on row G, and that was cell G8. She lightly placed a 2. 
There was obviously only one spot for a 4 on row D, and that was cell D1. So she sketched one there. 

Alice looked for the next move.

Alice brushed the hair away from her eyes. She wiped off her glasses with a cloth.

Alice began to daydream. 
Thinking about Bob usually soothed her, but... She had a recollection about her children. She was troubled about her children. Dreary colors filled her mind.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
She felt she was making good headway, but still had some work to do.

Once again she checked for a move.
This left cell E1 with only one option: a 5. 
So she put it there. 
Alice found that cell H1 could only contain a 9: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She lightly added a 9. 
She found that cell H5 could only contain a 5: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She lightly drew a 5. 
Alice realized she had reached a dead end. There were no more squares she could fill, and no more moves to try.

Alice sighed, then erased her work, until the board once again matched [position T](#position-T).

Alice decided to try putting a 4 into cell C1.

Alice started looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
Alice found that cell C3 could only contain a 1: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she etched one there. 
A careful check through row D showed that cell D4 surely HAD to be a 4. So she placed one there. 
There was clearly only one spot for a 2 on row D - cell D1. She lightly sketched in a 2 at D1. 
She found that cell F1 could only contain a 5: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully added in a 5 in F1. 
This left cell F6 with only one option: a 2.

Alice wiped off her glasses with a cloth. She gazed out the window at the rising sun.

Alice began to daydream. 
Drab colors filled her mind. She was troubled about work. People often told her not to focus on negative things, but it was difficult. She thought idly of Hannah.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Many of the cells remained unfilled.

Again Alice checked for a move.
She found that cell G3 could only contain a 3: all other digits were blocked somehow.

Alice sighed, then erased her work, until the board once again matched [position R](#position-R).

Alice decided to try putting a 9 into cell A3.

Alice started looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 

Again she checked for a move.
Row B had a cell B5 which, Alice discovered, could only contain a 9. So she etched one there. 
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position U'.

### Position U

Alice considered her next move. She compiled the shortest list of options. From here, she could 
place a 2 in A6, 
or place a 7 in A6. 
Alice decided to try putting a 2 into cell A6.

Alice continued looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
This left cell A9 with only one option: a 6. 
She quickly inserted a 6 at A9. 
This left cell A8 with only one option: a 7. 
So she wrote it there. 
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position V'.

Alice considered her next move. She compiled the shortest list of options. From here, she could 
place a 1 in B9, 
or place a 2 in B9. 
Alice decided to try putting a 1 into cell B9.

Alice started looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 

Alice looked for the best move.
Row E had a cell E8 which, Alice realized, could only be a 1. So she added one there. 
Box 6 contained a cell F8 which, she realized, could only contain a 6. So she etched it there. 

She scanned for the next move.
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position W'.

Alice considered her next move. She compiled the shortest list of options. From here, she could 
place a 2 in B1, 
or place a 8 in B1. 
Alice decided to try putting a 2 into cell B1.

Alice resumed looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 

Again she checked for a cell.
This left cell B3 with only one option: a 8. 
So she drew one there. 
There was clearly only one location for a 2 on row F, and that was cell F3. So she pencilled one there. 
This left cell D3 with only one option: a 4. 
So she inserted one there. 
This left cell C3 with only one option: a 1. 
So she drew it there. 

She scanned the puzzle again.
This left cell C1 with only one option: a 4. 
She carefully etched in a 4. 

Alice scanned the puzzle carefully.
She found that cell E2 could only contain a 9: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully etched in a 9 in E2. 

She scanned for the best move.
This left cell I2 with only one option: a 4. 
She put in a 4. 
A quick scan through column 9 revealed that cell G9 HAD to be a 4. So she wrote it there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice took a sip of her coffee. She sharpened her pencil to a point.

Alice allowed her mind to wander. 
Muted colors filled her mind. Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page. What was it they'd said? Her mind called up images of Bob.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.

She looked for the best move.
A search through column 4 revealed that cell E4 HAD to be a 4. She quickly added in a 4 at E4. 
There was obviously only one location for a 3 on row E - cell E9. She quickly added a 3 at E9. 
This left cell C9 with only one option: a 2. 
So she drew it there. 

She scanned for the best move.
This left cell C8 with only one option: a 3. 
She etched in a 3 in C8. 
This left cell I9 with only one option: a 9. 
She quickly pencilled a 9 in I9. 
Alice found that cell D9 could only contain a 5: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She lightly wrote a 5 at D9. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice studied the puzzle intently. She took a deep breath.

Alice began to daydream. 
She thought idly of computers. Something about Hannah was making her uncomfortable. Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page. Thinking about work usually soothed her, but...

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Many of the cells remained unfilled.
She found that cell D1 could only contain a 8: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she drew it there. 
She found that cell D8 could only contain a 9: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she put it there. 

Again Alice checked for a cell.
Alice found that cell H8 could only contain a 5: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she added one there. 
Alice found that cell G8 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She quickly drew a 2 in G8.

Alice wiped off her glasses with a cloth. She sighed softly.

Alice let her thoughts drift. 
Faded colors filled her mind. Something about Bob was making her uncomfortable. Her mind called up images of Hannah. She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving Hannah.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
Many of the cells remained unfilled.
Alice found that cell H3 could only contain a 6: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She put a 6. 
Alice realized she had reached a dead end. There were no more squares she could fill, and no more moves to try.

Alice sighed, then erased her work, until the board once again matched [position W](#position-W).

Alice decided to try putting a 8 into cell B1.

Alice resumed looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
This left cell B3 with only one option: a 2.

She found that cell F3 could only contain a 7: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully placed a 7 at F3. 
Alice found that cell F6 could only contain a 5: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she added one there. 

Again she checked for a cell.
Alice found that cell F1 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She quickly placed a 2 in F1. 

Alice looked for the best move.
There was clearly only one square for a 8 on row D, and that was cell D3. So she drew it there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice let her thoughts drift. 
She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving computers. Thoughts of the news nagged at the edge of her consciousness. She was troubled about her children. What was it they'd said?

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.
Alice sighed. There were no obvious moves left.

She jotted down a picture of the position on a notepad, and labeled it 'Position X'.

Alice considered her next move. She compiled the shortest list of options. From here, she could 
place a 2 in C1, 
or place a 4 in C1. 
Alice decided to try putting a 2 into cell C1.

Alice began looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 

She looked for the best move.
This left cell C3 with only one option: a 4. 
So she added one there. 

Again she checked for a cell.
Row F had a cell F3 which, she realized, could only be a 2. She placed a 2. 
A thorough review through row H showed that cell H1 absolutely HAD to be a 4. So she sketched one there. 

Again Alice checked for a move.
She found that cell I2 could only contain a 9: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully placed in a 9 in I2. 
This left cell E2 with only one option: a 4. 
So she added it there. 
Row D included a cell D4 which, she realized, could only contain a 4. She lightly wrote in a 4 at D4. 
Box 5 had a cell E4 which, Alice discovered, could only be a 3. So she put one there. 
A scan of row H uncovered that cell H8 surely must be a 9. So she placed one there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice brushed the hair away from her eyes. She studied the puzzle intently.

Alice allowed her mind to wander. 
She thought idly of computers. She couldn't help playing out some scenarios involving Hannah. People often told her not to focus on negative things, but it was difficult. Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Many of the cells remained unfilled.
There was really only one location for a 5 on row H, and that was cell H5. So she sketched one there. 
This left cell C5 with only one option: a 7. 
She carefully inserted in a 7 at C5. 
This left cell C4 with only one option: a 5. 
She quickly wrote a 5. 
Alice found that cell G4 could only contain a 7: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she added one there. 

She reviewed the puzzle again.
Alice found that cell G5 could only contain a 3: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she drew it there. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice wiped off her glasses with a cloth. She took a sip of her coffee.

Alice began to daydream. 
What was it they'd said? Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page. Something about Bob was making her uncomfortable. She was troubled about her children.

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
Many of the cells remained unfilled.

Alice scanned for the next move.
She found that cell G3 could only contain a 6: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she added one there. 
This left cell E3 with only one option: a 7. 
So she wrote one there. 
Alice found that cell E6 could only contain a 5: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she drew one there. 
This left cell F6 with only one option: a 7. 
She etched in a 7. 

Alice scanned the puzzle carefully.
This left cell G1 with only one option: a 1. 
So she placed it there. 
Alice realized she had reached a dead end. There were no more squares she could fill, and no more moves to try.

Alice sighed, then erased her work, until the board once again matched [position Z](#position-Z).

Alice decided to try putting a 4 into cell C1.

Alice continued looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
She found that cell C3 could only contain a 2: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully inserted in a 2 in C3. 
Row F included a cell F1 which, Alice determined, could only contain a 2. So she inserted it there. 
There was really only one square for a 4 on row D - cell D4. She sketched in a 4.

Alice studied the puzzle intently. She sharpened her pencil to a point.

Alice started to reminisce. 
She was troubled about computers. Her mind called up images of Hannah. Thinking about computers usually soothed her, but... Thoughts of her children nagged at the edge of her consciousness.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
Most of the puzzle was still unsolved.

She reviewed the puzzle again.
This left cell E2 with only one option: a 4. 
So she inserted one there. 
She found that cell H1 could only contain a 6: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully drew a 6 at H1.

Alice decided to try putting a 7 into cell A6.

Alice started looking for squares to fill on her puzzle. 
There was clearly only one option for a 7 on row C - cell C8. So she wrote one there. 

Once again Alice checked for a move.
Row C contained a cell C9 which, Alice determined, could only contain a 3. So she etched one there. 
Box 3 included a cell B9 which, she discovered, could only contain a 1. She etched in a 1 in B9. 
A quick search through row E revealed that cell E8 absolutely was a 1. So she drew one there. 

She looked for the best move.
Row E had a cell E4 which, Alice discovered, could only hold a 3. So she drew it there.

Alice took a sip of her coffee. She checked her phone for notices.

Alice allowed her mind to wander. 
Some of her visions were mixing with the numbers on her page. She thought idly of writing. People often told her not to focus on negative things, but it was difficult. What was it they'd said?

Alice refocused her attention on her puzzle.
She was getting quite close to a solution!
She found that cell H3 could only contain a 6: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She carefully inserted in a 6. 

Alice looked for the next move.
Alice found that cell H5 could only contain a 5: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She sketched a 5 in H5. 
She found that cell H7 could only contain a 3: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she pencilled it there. 

Again she checked for a cell.
This left cell H8 with only one option: a 9. 
She lightly pencilled in a 9 at H8. 
Alice found that cell I6 could only contain a 9: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
She quickly drew a 9 in I6. 
Her puzzle now looked like this.

Alice checked her phone for notices. She sighed softly.

Alice started to reminisce. 
Thinking about writing usually soothed her, but... What was it they'd said? Faded colors filled her mind. People often told her not to focus on negative things, but it was difficult.

Alice returned her attention on her puzzle.
She was getting quite close to a solution!
She found that cell I9 could only contain a 4: all other digits were blocked somehow. 
So she etched one there. 
Alice stopped. The puzzle was completely filled.

Alice paused to review the problem she had just finished. 
This Sudoku layout was somewhat more complicated, and she felt it was tricky. 
All that backtracking made it frustrating, too. Alice had made made a mess of her paper by erasing so many things. Still, she was pleased with the end result.
Maybe the next problem would be even more difficult!

Alice checked the time again, wondering if there was time for another puzzle.

Alice closed the puzzle book. Her coffee had grown cold, and she had a lot of things to accomplish today.
She was pretty sure that Bob was having an affair.
